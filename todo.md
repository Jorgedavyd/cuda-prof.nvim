# Ideas

## Compilation
1. Setup of nvcc for all comands

## Profiling
1. Setup for Nsight Computing. (I don't know the cli tool)
2. Setup for Nsight Systems. (nsys)
3. Setup for Visual Profiler. (nvvp)

## Sessionized framework
1. Try to create sessions for joint iteration.

## Diff view
1. Creating diff views someway with a harpoon like interface.

## Extra
Maybe visualization of metrics with db in lua.
